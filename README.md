 ## Description
 To start, I installed jest.  This allowed me to create tests.  I created tests for the Manager, Intern, Engineer, and the Employee function. I downloaded the inquirer package from npmjs.com. I used inquirer to add questions that would be sent to the terminal. These questions were used to collect information from the user. The answers to all these questions were used to create a team profile. I then wrote a writeFile function which starts the program when a user types "node index" into the terminal. After that, I wrote a "copyFile" function which would copy the css file so the newly created html could use it. 

 ## Installation 
 If you are interested in trying this application out, please go to npmjs.com. Look for the inquirer package and download that package.  The jest package can also be used with this program.

 ## Usage 
 The project's intended use is to create a team profile that contains each team member's information.

 ## Contributing 
 Contributions are not being accepted at this time.

 ## Tests 
 Tests have been performed using npm jest.
